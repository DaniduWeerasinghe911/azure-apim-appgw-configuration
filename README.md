# Azure Cost Optimizer

This project contains an initial scaffold for the **Azure Cost Optimizer** service. The goal is to build a small SaaS solution that analyzes Azure usage and highlights potential savings.

## Project Structure

- `frontend/` – React application (Vite) for the dashboard
- `backend/` – FastAPI server providing cost analysis APIs
- `infra/` – Infrastructure as code (Bicep or Terraform) to deploy the service

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies for the backend and frontend
3. Run the FastAPI server and start the React dev server

This repository is only a starting point. Follow the project plan to implement Azure authentication, cost data collection, the insights engine, and the web dashboard.
